# Screening of eye disease using retinal images 
  Our project aims to develop an efficient screening system using transfer learning algorithms to detect and classify eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. The current standard method of manual examination by ophthalmologists is time-consuming, costly, and causes an  errors. Through transfer learning, we plan to leverage pre-trained deep learning models on large-scale datasets to create a robust and accurate model for automated eye disease detection.
# Transfer Learning technique:
   we utilize a pre-trained CNN model as the foundation and fine-tune it for our specific  retinal eye disease detection task.
